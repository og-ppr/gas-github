Chrome-extension to manage Google Apps Script(GAS) code with your favorite SCM service(github/github enterprise/bitbucket/gitlab).

With this extension, you can manage your code in GAS editor, push code to a new created branch, pull from a repository/branch.

The extension does not use the Google Drive API, so you don't need any google authentication. Moreover, this extension supports **Bound scripts**.

# **NOTICE**
This extension is a hack of the GAS IDE's internal RPC, so there's no guarantee of anything. This extension can break at **ANYTIME** if Google changes their api.

# 1.Install
Install this extension from [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lfjcgcmkmjjlieihflfhjopckgpelofo).

# 2.Usage
After install, when you open GAS editor, a new button will appear to allow you to login to GitHub/GitHub Enterprise/Bitbucket/GitLab.

## 2.1.Login
Login to your GitHub/GitHub Enterprise/Bitbucket/GitLab account, with Two-factor authentication support for GitHub/GitHub Enterprise.
You can also use an existed token for GitHub/GitHub Enterprise/GitLab.

Actually, this is not a login action, but to create the `access token` which will be used for the extension
>Note: the access token will be stored in `chrome.storage.sync`(password will not be stored), if you take this as a security hole, pleast **DO NOT** use this extension.

## 2.2.Bind
After login, you can bind your GAS Project with repo and branch, or create a new one.

## 2.3.Manage
Manage your code with the similar `Push` and `Pull`.But there are something you need to know before you use it.

### 2.3.1.Create Repository/Branch
In `Repo` and `Branch` dropdown list, there is an option to Create new Repo and Branch.

New Repo will be created with an init, with a default README.md.

### 2.3.2.Pull and Push
The **PULL/PUSH** is not actually the same as GitHub/Bitbucket's **PULL/PUSH**, because GAS project does not have any git info, so what we can do is limited.

The differences are:

- `Pull` will fetch code from the bind Repository/Branch, and **OVERWRITE** to current GAS Project. There is no merge operation.
- `Push` will make all your change like one commit, If your want to make your process clearly, please push everytime you want a commit.

Other points:
- A diff dialog will be shown before you confirm to `Push` or `Pull`.
- You can choose files to operate with in the diff dialog.
- `Push` must have a commit comment which will be added from the diff dialog.

#### 2.3.2.1 Gist
For using Gist, select `Using Gist` in the `Repo` dropdown list, then `Branch` dropdown will changed to `Gist`. But since gist do not has a name, you need to select the id to specific which gist to sync(a tooltip will show description of the gist).
>Note: Bitbucket's snippet is not supported.

- If there is no gist, you can create one from the extension.
- The gist created from extension will be initialzated with a default `init_by_gas_hub.html` file, this will be delete when first time you push you code to gist. 
- You can change the description when push.
- Same as sync to repo, only file added and file changed is supported.

## 2.4.Logout
You can logout from the extension's option page any time. After logout, the access token stored in extension will be deleted, 
but you will need to delete the token or revoke Bitbucket's oauth yourself from SCM's settins page.

 - G Suite Users (aka paid Google Apps) need to perform extra steps
   * Go Admin Console
   * Go Device Management > Chrome management
   * Go User settings > Apps & Extensions > Managed force-installed apps
   * Go Chrome Web Store and type gas-github (in search box)
   * Click Add > Click Save (to Force-installed Apps & Extensions)
   * Since this is a developer tool, in same page, go User Experience
   * In Developer Tools, select "Always allow use of built-in developer tools"
   * Click Save (to User settings ; it will be at the very bottom of page)
   * Reload GAS IDE (or logout / log back in to account).

   You should now see the new buttons for this extension. If the above needs clarification via pictures, you can see generic detail [here](https://support.texthelp.com/help/equatio-how-to-deploy-apps-and-extensions-through-the-google-admin-console).
 
PS: There is a similar [extension](https://github.com/leonhartX/lambda-github) for sync your AWS lambda code.
